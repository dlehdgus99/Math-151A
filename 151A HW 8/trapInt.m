%  This function returns the result of applying the composite
%  trapezoidal rule to a function over the interval [a,b] using n panels.
%
%  On entry : F        = Function handle for function being integrated  
%             a        = left integration endpoint
%             b        = right integration endpoint
%             n        = number of panels to use in the integration formula
%
%  Returned : the approximate value of the integral.
